LINE PLOT - Calculates Change in Free Energy Among Different Sizes of Complexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

free_energy(FileName, FileNum, InitialTime, FinalTime, SpeciesName, ShowFig, SaveFig, SaveVars)

Description:
The plot indicates the change in free energy over a selected time frame among different sizes of complexes. The x-axis represents the size of the complex, and the y-axis represents the free energy calculated in units of KbT, where the probability of occurrence of the number of times an N-mer is counted (including association and dissociation) is used. If multiple input files are provided, the output plot will show the average value of all files, including an error bar.

Parameters:

- **FileName** (str): The path to the `.dat` file, usually named `transition_matrix_time.dat`, representing the histogram data to be analyzed. For multiple files, they should be named `[name]_1.dat`, `[name]_2.dat`, etc., and `FileName` should be `[name].dat`.
    
    - Example: `transition_1.dat`, `transition_2.dat` ... `FileName = transition.dat`

- **FileNum** (int): The total number of input files. If multiple files are provided, their names should follow the naming rule.

- **InitialTime** (float): The initial time in seconds to be examined. Must be smaller than `FinalTime` and greater than the start time in the file.

- **FinalTime** (float): The final time in seconds to be examined. Must be greater than `InitialTime` and smaller than the maximum time in the file.

- **SpeciesName** (str): The name of the species to be examined, which should match the name in the input (.inp and .mol) files.

- **DivideSize** (int, optional, default=2): Value that distinguishes the size of the associate complex.

- **SaveFig** (bool, optional, default=False): Whether to save the plot as a `.png` file.

- **SaveVars** (bool, optional, default=False): Whether to save the values in text or `.csv` files. The files will be saved in a folder called `vars`.

Returns:

- **cmplx_size** (list): List of each complex size.

- **std** (list): The standard deviation of mean energy.
