Syntax and Formatting
---------------------

1. Variables are named in camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter. E.g., `int copyNumber;`
2. Functions/subroutines are named in snake_case. E.g., `void run_my_function();`
3. Booleans should start with "is" or something that implies a true/false response. E.g., `bool isLipid;`
4. Do not put code in header (.h) files. They are only for declarations. Exclude any function definitions, including constructors/destructors.
